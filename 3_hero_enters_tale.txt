Our Hero Bade Mood enters the tale!

Bade Mood has a friend. His name is Jack Alwaysy. He is a short man in his late 50s

Alwaysy is not very strong, he always loses in a fist fight. 

But he has a way with words and can always talk his way out of a situation.

Alwaysy is always there to back up his best firend Bade Mood.

Bade Mood is always in a bad mode, he hates everything and everyone.

Some might argue that he is not a real hero.

But Made Mood doesn't care at all!
